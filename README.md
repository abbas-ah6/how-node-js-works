```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-behind-the-scenes.git

```
2. Navigate into the project directory.
   
```bash
cd nodejs-behind-the-scenes

```
3. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install

```
4. Explore the code examples provided in the project files.

## Code Structure

The project is structured as follows:

    index.js: Main entry point of the application containing various code examples demonstrating Node.js functionality.
    module-*.js: Additional modules containing reusable code snippets and examples.
    test-file.txt: Sample text file used in file system operations.

Code Structure
The project is structured as follows:

index.js: Main entry point of the application containing various code examples demonstrating Node.js functionality.
module-*.js: Additional modules containing reusable code snippets and examples.
test-file.txt: Sample text file used in file system operations.
Usage
Run the Node.js application to see the code examples in action.

bash
Copy code
node index.js
This will execute the code snippets defined in index.js and output the results to the console.

Examples
File System Operations
The project demonstrates various file system operations using the fs module, including reading files synchronously and asynchronously, as well as streaming file data.

Asynchronous Programming
Explore asynchronous programming concepts in Node.js through examples such as event handling with EventEmitter and asynchronous function calls using setTimeout.

HTTP Server
Learn how to create a basic HTTP server using the http module, handle incoming requests, and serve responses.
